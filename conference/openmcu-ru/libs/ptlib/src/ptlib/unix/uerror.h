 * conference is the CDOT-MCU (CDOT conferencing server or CDOT- multipoint control unit)
 * It should be integrated with CDOT-ngms (in MAX-NG C5 or any other SIP PROXY, which can actually land the conferencing call on the CDOT-MCU)
 * CDOT-MCU works as service provider (roomNo@serviceIP:Port)
 * room number should be dialed from any point such as MAX-NG C5 or any proxy, because a SIP hardphone can not dial the full SIP-URI (roomNo@serviceIP:Port) hence there should be any intermediate entity.
