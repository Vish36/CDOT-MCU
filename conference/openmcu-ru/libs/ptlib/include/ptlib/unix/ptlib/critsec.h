 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2020/01/20 06:08:43  bishnu
 * conference is the CDOT-MCU (CDOT conferencing server or CDOT- multipoint control unit)
 * It should be integrated with CDOT-ngms (in MAX-NG C5 or any other SIP PROXY, which can actually land the conferencing call on the CDOT-MCU)
 * CDOT-MCU works as service provider (roomNo@serviceIP:Port)
 * room number should be dialed from any point such as MAX-NG C5 or any proxy, because a SIP hardphone can not dial the full SIP-URI (roomNo@serviceIP:Port) hence there should be any intermediate entity.
 *
 * For more Details go through the 'conferncing_Overview-mod' document

 * Final version of CDOT-MCU

 * Revision 1.6  2007/09/05 11:09:09  csoutheren
 * Removed misleading and incorrect code from Linux implementation of
 * PCriticalSection. Apologies to Hannes Friederich :(
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2007/09/05 08:03:25  hfriederich
 * Implement PCriticalSection with named semaphores
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/11/04 06:56:10  csoutheren
 * Added new class PSync as abstract base class for all mutex/sempahore classes
 * Changed PCriticalSection to use Wait/Signal rather than Enter/Leave
 * Changed Wait/Signal to be const member functions
 * Renamed PMutex to PTimedMutex and made PMutex synonym for PCriticalSection.
 * This allows use of very efficient mutex primitives in 99% of cases where timed waits
 * are not needed
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/07/11 07:56:36  csoutheren
 * Applied jumbo VxWorks patch, thanks to Eize Slange
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/04/18 12:37:40  csoutheren
 * Modified to detect sem_wait etc on Linux systems
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/04/11 03:02:07  csoutheren
 * Initial version
