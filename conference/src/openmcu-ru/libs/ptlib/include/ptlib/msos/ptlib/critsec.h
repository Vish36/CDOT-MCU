 * conference is the CDOT-MCU (CDOT conferencing server or CDOT- multipoint control unit)
 * It should be integrated with CDOT-ngms (in MAX-NG C5 or any other SIP PROXY, which can actually land the conferencing call on the CDOT-MCU)
 * CDOT-MCU works as service provider (roomNo@serviceIP:Port)
 * room number should be dialed from any point such as MAX-NG C5 or any proxy, because a SIP hardphone can not dial the full SIP-URI (roomNo@serviceIP:Port) hence there should be any intermediate entity.
 *

 * CDOT-MCU  conferencing module
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/11/04 06:34:20  csoutheren
 * Added new class PSync as abstract base class for all mutex/sempahore classes
 * Changed PCriticalSection to use Wait/Signal rather than Enter/Leave
 * Changed Wait/Signal to be const member functions
 * Renamed PMutex to PTimedMutex and made PMutex synonym for PCriticalSection.
 * This allows use of very efficient mutex primitives in 99% of cases where timed waits
 * are not needed
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/04/11 02:55:18  csoutheren
 * Added PCriticalSection for Windows
 * Added compile time option for PContainer to use critical sections to provide thread safety under some circumstances
